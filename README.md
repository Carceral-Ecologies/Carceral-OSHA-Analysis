## About - The Carceral OSHA Data Project

This repository aims to document a project, that is being developed by Dr. Savannah Hunter, UCB, Professor Nicholas Shapiro, UCLA, and Professor Lindsay Poirier, Smith College to analyze data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to cast light on conditions within prisons, jails, and other carceral facilities.  

We are managing our work flow through the [issues](https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/Carceral-ECHO-data/issues) function. Thats probably the best place to start contributing. 

This work is in progress.
